In consideration for your use of the Service, you agree as follows:<br />
1. General Terms &amp; Conditions<br />
    I   Changes To These Terms. You understand and agree that the Company may change these Terms at any time in its sole discretion without prior notice, provided that the Company will use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any material changes that may apply to you, including through the posting of a revised Terms of Service that you may be required to accept in order to continue using the Service. You may read a current, effective copy of these Terms at any time by selecting the appropriate link on the Service. The revised Terms will become effective at the time of posting. Any use of the Service after such date will constitute your acceptance of such revised Terms. If any change to these Terms is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop accessing, browsing and otherwise using the Service. The terms of these Terms of Service will govern any updates the Company provides to you that replace and/or supplement any portion of the Service, unless such update is accompanied by a separate license or revised Terms, in which case the terms of that license or revised Terms will govern. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 1.II, no revisions to these Terms will apply to any dispute between you and the Company that arose prior to the effective date of such revision.<br />
    II  Additional Agreements &amp; Terms.

<p>III Company Action. We respect the intellectual property rights of others and will respond to clear notices of alleged infringement. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the foregoing requirements, your Notice may be invalid. We reserve the right to remove User Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice to you and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, such as in cases of repeat infringement, we also reserve the right to suspend or terminate the infringing User’s Account in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>IV  Repeat Infringer Policy. The Company’s intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or disable access to material that the Company believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (ii) remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by “repeat infringers. ”The Company considers a “repeat infringer” to be any User that has uploaded User Content to or through the Service and for whom the Company has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. §512 with respect to such User Content. The Company has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon the Company’s own determination.</p>
<p>V   Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from the Company that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide the Company with a “Counter Notification” which, to be effective must be provided, in writing, to the Company’s Designated Agent via one of the methods identified in Section5.II above, and must include substantially the following information:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;<br />
ii) Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works;<br />

iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the Company to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;<br />
v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and<br />
vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>We advise you to consult with a lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>VI  Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If you submit a Counter Notification to the Company in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then the Company will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that the Company will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in ten (10) business days, and the Company will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless the Company’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Company’s system or network.

VII False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512(f)) provides, in pertinent part:
</pre></div>


<p>“any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [the Company] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.”</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.<br />
6. General Use of the Service<br />
    I   The Service is constantly evolving and by your use you acknowledge that the Service may change from time to time, at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company may permanently or temporarily stop providing the Service or any features within the Service to you or to users generally. The Company also retains the right to create limits on use and storage at its sole discretion at any time. The Company may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Service, suspend or terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.<br />
    II  In consideration for the Company granting you access to and use of the Service, you agree that the Company and its third-party providers and partners may place advertising on the Service or in connection with the display of User Content or information from the Service whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse the Service, as follows:<br />

7. Features of the Service - Virtual Items<br />
    I   Company offers a feature allowing users to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual B-Vision coins (“Coins”) for use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-Service items (“Gifts”). Any Coins and/or Gifts that are gifted to Users (or received by you) within the Service are converted to Virtual “Diamonds” in the receiving User’s User Account. Virtual Coins, together with Gifts and Diamonds, are hereafter collectively referred to as &ldquo;Virtual Items.” The purchase of any Virtual Items must be made lawfully, under legitimate means, and with actual currency. Notwithstanding your purchase or possession of such Virtual Items, you acknowledge and agree that you do not in fact &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, Company grants you a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that may manifest themselves as these items.<br />
    II  You acknowledge and agree that your distribution of any Virtual Items currently in your account (i.e. as a virtual &ldquo;tip&rdquo; to any other User&rsquo;s account) may result in some revenue to such recipient User, as determined in Company&rsquo;s sole discretion, and is made solely at your own discretion; you further understand that once you have confirmed a transfer of any Virtual Item to another user&rsquo;s account, the action cannot be undone and the Virtual Item cannot be withdrawn. Notwithstanding, Company makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the Virtual Items you may give a User will correlate to the revenue such User may receive from Company.<br />
    III The purchase of Virtual Items is a completed transaction upon Company&rsquo;s confirmation of electronic payment from you via the iTunes App Store or Google Play. Any virtual currency balance shown in your User Account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license to the Virtual Items within the Service. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual or real currency credited back to your User Account, nor will you be able to receive a refund (“Refund”) of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), including if your access to the Service has been suspended, limited or terminated pursuant to these Terms.<br />
    IV  The value (i.e. the exchange rate) of the Virtual Items is determined by Company in its sole discretion, based on your country of origin, and Company further reserves the right to modify the purchase exchange rate between actual currency and Virtual Coins from time to time, with or without reason, in its sole discretion. By your use of the Service, you confirm your understanding of and accept the then-current exchange rate of any Virtual Items at the time of your purchase.<br />
    V   Your use of any Virtual Items purchased shall be solely for legitimate purposes within the Service, and must comply with all applicable laws at all times (i.e. no exchanging of Virtual Items for any activity, product, conduct or services deemed unauthorized by these Terms or our Community Policy).<br />
    VI  You understand that the purchase of Virtual Items requires actual money. If you disagree with any part of, or do not fully understand our exchange rate policy, please refrain from purchasing or using any Virtual Items in connection with the Service.<br />
    VII You understand that B-Vision Live may change, modify or update these Terms, or the terms of sale in connection with the Virtual Items from time to time, and that such revised terms will apply to all subsequent purchases of any Virtual Items, and you agree that you will review these Terms and any terms regarding the sale of Virtual Items prior to making any purchase.<br />
    VIII    In the event your account balance is incorrect due to system maintenance or other technical failures as determined by Company in its sole discretion, Company agrees to make all necessary corrections and adjustments with respect to your account balance. If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions regarding purchases and/or payments regarding the Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:finance@bvisionnetwork.com">finance@bvisionnetwork.com</a>.<br />
8. Virtual B-Vision coins– Cashing-Out<br />
    I   Notwithstanding the above restriction regarding Refunds, any Diamonds or Virtual Items stored in your User Account that exceeds the value of forty-thousand (40,000) B-vision coin, either by your own purchase or by receipt from another User may be &ldquo;cashed-out&rdquo; for actual currency (each transaction, a “Cash-Out”). The value of currency received from any Cash-Out shall be in United States dollars and shall be determined by Company&rsquo;s then-current exchange rate, which Company may set and change from time to time in its sole discretion. The Cash-Out exchange rate may also change due to the fluctuating value of the Coins, which may change between the time they were purchased and the time you decide to Cash-Out.<br />
    II  You must have an active PayPal account to Cash-out. Your Paypal account will be linked to your User Account when you Cash-Out and the payment will be processed within fifteen (15) business days following any Cash-Out request.<br />
    III The amount of any Cash-Out cannot exceed the amount of available funds in your User Account (as determined by the then-determined value of Virtual Items in your account). The minimum amount required for any Cash-Out is two hundred (USD $200) dollars, and Users can Cash-Out a maximum of six hundred (USD $600) dollars per day.<br />
    IV  Company does not charge a withdrawal fee to Cash-Out, however, there a PayPal transaction fees may apply. Note: you are solely responsible for checking PayPal’s Terms of Service for policy details and applicability of transaction fees.<br />
    V   Each Cash-Out request will be manually approved by Company staff for security reasons which may take up to fifteen (15) days following the Cash-Out request. Cash-out requests involving suspicious account activity and/or information may be denied. In some circumstances, PayPal may place your Cash-Out funds received on a temporary twenty-one (21) day hold based on minimal or no previous transaction history with Company to demonstrate a pattern of positive money exchanges. In the event such a hold occurs, please allow twenty-one (21) calendar days for your Cash-Out funds to be transferred to your PayPal account. In any event, Company shall not be responsible in any way for any financial holds initiated by PayPal.<br />
    VI  User Inactivity. If your account remains inactive for six (6) consecutive months, all of your Virtual Items will be frozen.

Upon receipt of your request and review of your information, we will unfreeze your Virtual Items within 3 days.<br />
9. Confiscation of Virtual Items Due To Termination Or Fraud<br />
    I   IMPORTANT: The Company takes fraud extremely seriously. In addition to taking any applicable and necessary legal action, Company reserves the right to permanently confiscate any Virtual Items from any User Account that it determines, in its sole discretion, were purchased or acquired using fraudulent means; this includes confiscation of any Virtual Gifts received by you from another User in which such Virtual Gifts were purchased fraudulently. In the event Company determines that and Virtual Items were fraudulently purchased, Company will notify you prior to confiscation and allow you an opportunity to make an appeal via the App.<br />
    II  If Company terminates your account for cause (including fraud), any outstanding Virtual Items remaining in your account at the time of termination may be irrevocably confiscated, as determined by Company in its sole and absolute discretion, in accordance with our Account Termination Policy specified below.<br />

<li>Dispute Resolution<br />
    I   Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. THE COMPANY (AND ITS RESPECTIVE CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, PERMITTED ASSIGNS), YOU AND ANY OTHER PARTIES ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SERVICE AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> for more information.<br />
    II  Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by a reputable courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to the Company, to you via any other method available to the Company, including via e-mail. The Notice to the Company should be addressed to: Xi One LLC, 1221 E. Dyer Road Unit 110, Santa Ana, CA92705, with a copy sent to: Murtaugh Meyer Nelson &amp; Treglia LLP<br />
– 2603 Main Street Penthouse, Irvine, CA 92614, Attn: Marshall Young, Esq. (<a href="mailto:myoung@mmnt.com">myoung@mmnt.com</a>) (the “Arbitration Notice Address”).The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”).If you and the Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS (“JAMS”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OF JAMS OR SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS THEREOF, INCLUDING THE OPTIONAL APPEAL PROCEDURE (THE “JAMS RULES”). The Jams Rules and JAMS forms are available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>.<br />
    III Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in Los Angeles County, California will be appointed pursuant to the Jams Rules, as modified herein. You and the Company agree the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br />
    IV  Equitable Relief; No Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, or patents. You acknowledge that, in the event the Company or a third party breaches these Terms, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against the Company, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.<br />
    V   Claims. You and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms, or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. All claims you bring against the Company must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, the Company may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to five thousand dollars ($5,000), provided that the Company has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.<br />
    VI  Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. You and the Company each further agree<br />
that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and the Company each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Article 13 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<br />
    VII 30 Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Ariticle 13 I, II, III, IV, V, VI by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email: <a href="mailto:liveme@cmcm.com">liveme@cmcm.com</a>. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.<br />
    VIII    Terms Modifications. In the event that the Company makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to the Company’s Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company’s Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your Account and your license to use the Service hereunder will terminate immediately. This Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of these Terms.</li>
